    For a save boot process a modification of the script /etc/init.d/pilight was 
    necessary. More details below


A short description how to setup a new SDcard for running pilight
with some important aspects for Jessie and it's changed networking

>>> Download the Jessie Light version and unzip it on your computer
>>> Write unzipped ZIP to the formatted (fat32 is required!) SDCard.
>>> Use a command like this with your individual dir/file settings
>>> and make sure you select the right destination device .. the SDCard:

   ~ $ sudo dd bs=4M if=/home/raspberryPI/img_zip/2017-03-02-raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/sdb

1390411776 bytes (1,4 GB) copied, 91,6304 s, 15,2 MB/s 

>>> after prompted back .. sync

   ~ $ sudo sync

>>> SDCard remove / insert --> to get now 2 Partitions

   ~ $ sudo df -h

/dev/sdb1        63M   21M   42M  33% /media/boot
/dev/sdb2       1,2G  741M  389M  66% /media/0aed834e-8c8f-412d-a276-a265dc676112


>>> Netzwork Setup:
--------------------
>>> With Jessie Light NOT to use /etc/network/interfaces to configure IPs
>>> instead   /etc/dhcpcd.conf

/etc/network/interfaces -- Reset to initial values
...................................................
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet manual
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual

>>>   Add the WLAN Config like this ( .. or use wpa_supplicant.conf):

wpa-ap-scan 1
wpa-scan-ssid 1
wpa-ssid "{nameOfWLAN}"
wpa-psk "{secretCodeofWLAN}"

>>>  Edit the new networking setup with

/etc/dhcpcd.conf  -- add at the end of the file 
......................................................
      interface eth0
      static ip_address=192.xxx.yyy.{IP1}/24
      static routers=192.xxx.yyy.1
      static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

      interface wlan0
      static ip_address=192.xxx.yyy.{IP2}/24
      static routers=192.xxx.yyy.1
      static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

   Note:  
      --- xxx.yyy  set it for your own net
      --- {IP}     an IP which is NOT part of the pool of the routers/DHCP!



>>> SSH ::    Attention for Jessie Light !
-----------------------------------------
   SSH Actiation needs an empty file with the name 'SSH' store on the boot partition!
     ~ $ sudo touch /media/boot/ssh
     ~ $ ls -lt /media/boot/ssh
     ~ $ cd ~


>>> Ready .. remove card from PC, install it to the RPI and boot it
>>> First boot takes a while ... 

>>> Booting the RPI with ssh will prompt this message:

   SSH is enabled and the default password for the 'pi' user has not been changed.
   This is a security risk - please login as the 'pi' user and type 'passwd' to set a new password.

>>> So next start the RPI Config

RPI Config starting
================================
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo raspi-config

>>>  recommend to set the following points:
  1. Expand Filesystem
  2. PW change  
  4. Locale Settings (location, language, keyboard)
  7. Advance Options (change the name of RPI on the network)

   Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool (raspi-config) 
   ├──────────────────────────────────────────────
 X |  1 Expand Filesystem            Ensures that all of the SD card storage is available to the OS
 X │  2 Change User Password         Change password for the default user (pi)
   │  3 Boot Options                 Configure options for start-up
 X │  4 Localisation Options         Set up language and regional settings to match your location
   │  5 Enable Camera                Enable this Pi to work with the Raspberry Pi Camera 
   │  6 Overclock                    Configure overclocking for your Pi 
 X │  7 Advanced Options             Configure advanced settings
   │  8 About raspi-config  

>>> Finishing will allow to reboot the RPI, then 
>>> on RPI do UPDATES !!

   ~ $ sudo apt-get update
   ~ $ sudo apt-get upgrade


>>> reboot

   ~ $ sudo shutdown -r 0

pilight Installation
=============================

Install pilight by using the apt repository in Debian / Ubuntu based distributions.
1. Login to your computer.

2. Make sure you are running as root. Run the following command and use your own password.

pi@pilight:~# sudo su
Password:

3. Add the apt repository to the apt sources list:
    ~# echo "deb http://apt.pilight.org/ stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pilight.list

If you want to install the nightly version of pilight then also add:

    ~# echo "deb http://apt.pilight.org/ nightly main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pilight.list

4. pilight uses a signed repository. This means packages get validated before installation. So, to safely download and install pilight packages the pilight key needs to be installed.

    ~# wget -O - http://apt.pilight.org/pilight.key | apt-key add -

5. Now update the apt package list:
    ~# apt-get update

6. And install pilight
    ~# apt-get install pilight


!!! >>>  Before starting as described with the pilight Manual instructions,
!!! >>>  follow the instructions below "pilight -- Checking/Setting after installation" 


7. When no errors are shown, pilight will be installed and automatically started at boot time. To manually start pilight:
   ~# service pilight start

8. And to stop pilight
   ~# service pilight stop

Exit to normal prompt
   ~# exit


pilight -- Checking/Setting after installation
================================================

1. Boot sequence 
Booting pilight gives a server/port setting. But for some operation also 
a Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) connection is required. 
With the older Raspian Wheezy it was not a problem, at boottime pilight 
got a ssdp connection.
With Jessie Light it is! At least with the (current) standard pilight setup.

To fix this the script /etc/init.d/pilight has to be modified with the first 
lines to get the following, edit with : 

~ $ sudo nano /etc/init.d/pilight
#! /bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          pilight-daemon
# Required-Start:    $local_fs $network $remote_fs $syslog
# Required-Stop:     $remote_fs $syslog
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: Starts pilight-daemon
# Description:       Starts pilight-daemon
#
### END INIT INFO


2. Runlevel
................................
There are comments on the pilight Forum the Runlevel with the standard 
installation isn't correct. Tests with Raspberry/Jessie Light didn't proved 
such complains. The following lines describe how to change the Runlevel. Also
not to change didn't gave failures for the setup or operation.
So the description is only for completeness.

Changing the Runlevel:
To get a successful pilight operation it's required to have correct startup. 
For that make sure the runlevel is set correctly.
Check it with the following command:

  pi@raspberrypi ~ $ cat /etc/init.d/pilight |grep Default-Start

>>>  Check to get only    
    # Default-Start:     3 4 5
>>>   If you have        2 3 4 5
>>>   You need to edit and delete runlevel 2 from the file!
    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo nano /etc/init.d/pilight


3. Development version
............................
If using the development version check the config.json file.
For upcoming features the file may have a line like this:
    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ cat /etc/pilight/config.json |grep webserver-http
                "webserver-https-port": 5002,

>>> Make sure NOT to include that line with https-port!
